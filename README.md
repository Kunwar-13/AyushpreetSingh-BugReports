This is a repository created by me(Ayushpreet Singh) for my Software Engineering Fundamentals assignment.
In this assisgnment we will have to create issue template for a bug report and submit 2 detailed bug report of any software of my choice and then create a feature template and then make 2 feature requests using that template.
For the Bug reports I chose PUBG mobile application and have written two bug reports based on bugs found in this game.
For the Feature requests I have chosen Call of Duty Mobile for the feature requsts and have written two features which i geniunly need in this game.
